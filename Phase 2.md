## Task Finalization ##
#### 1. Urdu voice Recognition . ####
#### 2. Multiple app on one screen, Auto Tweet and background music. ####

These are 2 tasks that we implement in our application.

## Need Finding ##
1. The Urdu voice Recognition option works on the basis of what user want to find in the Computer. User just click on the option "Suno yaar" and says in urdu whatever he or she wanted to find like open the browser, close or open any application and auto twite is simple idea .you can schedule the twite to any specific time.

2. The Multiple app on one screen is the main option of this application. Most used applicaion of users he/she can set those applications on a screen. For eg if user want to open the whatsapp and facebook simultaneouly or any other application Computer screen divided into parts. He/She can view multiple apps on a single screen.you can listen 
background music and also twite schduling is most important option on social websites 

The targeted audience are free or scoial media user they most of the time spend on soical web site for scrolling or uploading videos or images in social webs sites or spend the time listen the music.Social admin page user control so many apps simultaneously at a time are the main audience of this application.

### Scenarios

1) Suppose john wants to use our application firstly he open the app all the apps are available on the front screen. If he wants to open any file or any apps he can used our "Suno yaar" option on the left side just say in urdu and whatever he wants in the computer will appear on the screen.

2) Kamran is a content creator firstly he open this application whatever he wants to open many apps so he easily use apps simultaneously at a time on a single screen.

### Brainstorming
1) As we discussed this app is using old person and uneducated person as well they want all the options are visible on the screen.
2) Users confused how can be it possible to use many apps simultaneously.
3 Easily managed apps and there is no guidance need to used for this application.
4) Many tasks you can perform it on a single screen.
5) Some application you can used without a internet.
We made multiple designs and keeping these point of problems we selected the design No 3 and 4. These designs are little better among all the designs.
